# Main Features:
This project is mainly based on React-Js framework, focusing on firebase authentication system.
In the *Home(component) page there's four options for user to choice their vehicle to go for a trip.
I used Private Route here, to check does the user logged in or not? If the user is a guest(not registered or logged in), private Router will handover the user to the *LoginForm(component). After login user will be Redirect to the Destination(component) part. Here's some formality created...  

# Main Dependencies are 
    react-router-dom (for handling routing)
    react-hook-form(for making logging & register Form)
    google-maps-React(for using google map)
    firebase (for authentication)
    fontawesome (for using icons)
    react-bootstrap (for styling)

# My thoughts: 
Theres lot of struggles and ups & downs behind the project establishment. After all I can accomplished it within limited period and hopefull to acheive the satisfaction from my MENTOR!
